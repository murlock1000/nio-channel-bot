# Matrix Bot for replicating a Telegram channel.
Used Python 3.8.10
Created using the matrix-nio python api for matrix communications
Base template used: nio-template

# Functions
This bot is designed to redact messages (remove them) if:
the user that posted it is not an admin/moderator of the room and his message is not a thread reply.
I.E. if it's a regular message/regular reply - gets deleted. Messages made in threads are allowed.
When a user gets his message deleted - the bot creates/uses an existing DM room and informs the user about his attempt. Also increases the attempt count in the database.
After 3 attempts (3 message deletions) - the bot mutes (changes power level to -1) the user and resets the attempt count.


# Sources
bot template:       https://github.com/anoadragon453/nio-template
matrix-nio library: https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio

# Setup

Read the SETUP.md of the bot template repo
Setup for native mode (Could be setup in docker, did not try)
Installing libolm: apt install libolm-dev
Use default SQLite storage backend (postgres optional, may be used in future).

Create a bot user:
We will be using the @test.synapse.local user with pass: pass


# Changing Bot user message throttling settings
In order to allow the bot to respond to messages quickly,
we must overwrite the user message throttling settings,
We will be using the synapse Admin API to make a POST request to the server

Source
https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/

## Getting the admin api key
1. Create a matrix user with admin privileges
2. Log in with the user
3. Go to 'All settings' -> 'Help & About' -> 'Advanced' -> 'Access Token' (at the bottom)
4. Copy the Access Token.
# This token is only valid for the duration you are logged in with the user
 
## Making the API call
The call for overwriting the @test:synapse.local throttle settings is:
`curl --header "Authorization: Bearer ENTERADMINAPIKEYHERE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST -k http://localhost:8008/_synapse/admin/v1/users/@test:synapse.local/override_ratelimit`
Should return result of `{"messages_per_second":0, "burst_count":0}`
