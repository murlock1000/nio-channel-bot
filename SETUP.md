# Setup

Below is a quick setup guide to running the nio-channel-bot.

## Install the dependencies

There are two paths to installing the dependencies for development.

### Using `docker-compose`

It is **recommended** to use Docker Compose to run the bot while
developing, as all necessary dependencies are handled for you. After
installation and ensuring the `docker-compose` command works, you need to:

1. Create a data directory and config file by following the
   [docker setup instructions](docker#setup).

2. Create a docker volume pointing to that directory:

   ```
   docker volume create \
     --opt type=none \
     --opt o=bind \
     --opt device="/path/to/data/dir" nio_channel_bot_data_volume
   ```

Run `docker/start-dev.sh` to start the bot.

**Note:** If you are trying to connect to a Synapse instance running on the
host, you need to allow the IP address of the docker container to connect. This
is controlled by `bind_addresses` in the `listeners` section of Synapse's
config. If present, either add the docker internal IP address to the list, or
remove the option altogether to allow all addresses.

### Running natively

If you would rather not or are unable to run docker, the following will
instruct you on how to install the dependencies natively:

#### Install libolm

You can install [libolm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm) from source,
or alternatively, check your system's package manager. Version `3.0.0` or
greater is required and can be installed using:

```
sudo apt install libolm-dev
```

#### Python dev dependencies

```
sudo apt install python3-dev build-essential
```

**(Optional) postgres development headers**

By default, the bot uses SQLite as its storage backend. This is fine for a few
hundred users, but if you plan to support a much higher volume of requests, you
may consider using Postgres as a database backend instead.

If you want to use postgres as a database backend, you'll need to install
postgres development headers:

Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt install libpq-dev libpq5
```

Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S postgresql-libs
```

#### Install Python dependencies

We will be using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage our project dependencies.

- Create a Python 3 virtual environment:
    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv -p python3 env
    source ./env/bin/activate
    ```
- Install poetry and dependencies:
   ```
   pip install poetry
   poetry install
   ```

## Configuration

Copy the sample configuration file to a new `config.yaml` file.

```
cp sample.config.yaml config.yaml
```

Edit the config file. The `matrix` section must be modified at least.

#### (Optional) Set up a Postgres database

Create a postgres user and database for nio-channel-bot:

```
sudo -u postgresql psql createuser nio-channel-bot -W  # prompts for a password
sudo -u postgresql psql createdb -O nio-channel-bot nio-channel-bot
```

Edit the `storage.database` config option, replacing the `sqlite://...` string with `postgres://...`. The syntax is:

```
database: "postgres://username:password@localhost/dbname?sslmode=disable"
```

See also the comments in `sample.config.yaml`.

## Running

### Docker

Refer to the docker [run instructions](docker/README.md#running).

### Native installation

Make sure to source your python environment if you haven't already:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

Then simply run the bot with:

```
poetry run python3 main.py
```

By default, the bot will run with the config file at `./config.yaml`. However, an
alternative relative or absolute filepath can be specified after the command:

```
poetry run python3 main.py other-config.yaml
```

## Testing the bot works

Invite the bot to a room and it should accept the invite and join.

Create a new poll by selecting `More options` in the bottom right corner of Matrix Element (Other Interfaces available) and `Poll`. The nio-channel-bot should send a new message related to the poll, displaying the current votes with user tags.

## Changing bot user Message throttling settings
In order to allow the bot to respond to messages quickly without the synapse server throttling the messages,
we must overwrite the user message throttling settings.
We will be using the synapse Admin API to make a POST request to the server - 
[Documentation of synapse admin api](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/).

### Fetching the admin api key 
* Create a matrix user with admin privileges
* Log in with the user
* Go to 'All settings' -> 'Help & About' -> 'Advanced' -> 'Access Token' (at the bottom)
* Copy the Access Token.
This token is only valid for the duration you are logged in with the user!
 
### Make the API call 
The call for overwriting the @test:synapse.local user throttle settings is:

```
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer ENTERADMINAPIKEYHERE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST -k http://localhost:8008/_synapse/admin/v1/users/@test:synapse.local/override_ratelimit
```

It should return result of `{"messages_per_second":0, "burst_count":0}`

## Going forwards

Congratulations! Your bot is up and running. Now you can modify the code,
re-run the bot and see how it behaves. Have fun!
